[Verse]
I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

[Refrain]
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

[Verse]
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone. 

[Verse]
For nothing good have I
Where-by Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

[Verse]
And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat.
