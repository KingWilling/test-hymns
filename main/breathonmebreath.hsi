[Verse]
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
fill me with life anew,
that I may love the way you love,
and do what you would do. 

[Verse]
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
until my heart is pure,
until my will is one with yours,
to do and to endure. 

[Verse]
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
so shall I never die,
but live with you the perfect life
for all eternity.
